### CSS Changes

Changes were made to the CSS of the website to try and make it look like the screenshots as much as possible, as well as some adjustments to classes and ids that were necessary after I made accessibility changes.

### Accessibility Improvements

In an effort to make the website more accessible, we implemented a range of accessibility improvements. These changes include.

- Added alt text for images.
- Implemented semantic HTML.
- Inclusion of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes.
- Make sure the structure of the HTML is in sequential order.
- Ensure the HTML structure is logical
